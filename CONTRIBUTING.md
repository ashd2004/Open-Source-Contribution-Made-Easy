# Introduction

Thanks for your interest in Contributing to Open Source! 

As this repository is for beginners, who are new to making Contributions, we'll 
break down the guide as much as possible. This guide is a must read before you 
start contributing for this repository. 

In general, we try to follow [the Elm guidelines](https://twitter.com/czaplic/status/928359033844539393)
and ask that you try to as well:

  - Be kind.
  - Learn from everyone.
  - Collaboration requires communication.
  - Not every problem should be solved with code.
  - Communication _is_ contribution.
  - Understand the problem.
  - Explore all possible solutions.
  - Pick one.
  - Simplicity is not just for beginners.
  - It's better to do it _right_ than to do it _right now_.
  - It's not done until the docs are great.
  - Take responsibility for user experiences.
  - Make impossible states impossible.
  - There are worse things than being explicit...

We have created some issues in every project as a starting point for Beginners.
There are two major types of contribution:
  - Work on Existing Issues.
  - Create a new Issue and submit its changes related to it.
  
### Working on Existing Issues  

Check out the [issues](https://github.com/vardhanapoorv/Open-Source-Contribution-Made-Easy/issues) 
page and pick a issue you are interested in and add a comment mentioning the changes.
As this repository is for beginners, we do not have any restrictions on how the specifics
of implementation on how are fixing it, but we would want you to mention what are the 
changes you are proposing. Any proposal you made you be accepted anyway (unless there is 
a conflict with someone else's contribution).

There are some issues with tag `minimal-work`, these issues are meant for those who are
first timers, as there is no scope for making mistakes in this. Make sure that you do not 
create PRs with just `minimal-work` issues. We recommend that you have other issues that 
do not have `minimal-work` tag with the same PR.

### Creating new Issue 

A [new issue](https://github.com/vardhanapoorv/Open-Source-Contribution-Made-Easy/issues/new) 
could e created if you think more improvement could be done in existing application OR 
we are also open to new ideas for projects/languages to be included in this repository. 
We could discuss how it would make others contributing easier.

# Contributing changes

If you _are_ interested in contributing changes to `Open-Source-Contribution-Made-Easy`, 
please first select a issue or create a issue that you want to work on and 
comment in it mentioning that you have these proposed changes, then fork this
repository, make a new branch in your fork, commit your changes to that branch
and then make a pull request from that branch. Mention the issue As part of 
your pull request, make sure that you add yourself to the 
[Contributors list](https://github.com/vardhanapoorv/Open-Source-Contribution-Made-Easy/issues/10).

## Writing code

As we have multiple languages in this repository, when writing your code, try 
to follow existing code style as much as possible -
in particular, this means:

  - Wrap code (mostly) to 80 columns (type annotations and string literals can
    be longer if you want).
  - Use spaces instead of intends
  - Make sure to use meaningful names for variables.

Don't worry too much about writing documentation - small fixes for things like
typos and formatting are certainly welcome. In a major project repo documentation 
if important but you will get used to writing docs by contributing.

## Testing

In any other project, this would be of major importance for maintainers, as it 
is easier for them to verify changes. But we have kept this as optional in this 
repository.  If tests are exist for a given project, make sure that they pass 
before creating PR. If they don't exist and you want to create tests for it, 
create a new issue, explain your tests and create the PR. We would be happy to 
help. 

## Committing

Git commits should generally be as small and focused as possible, so that they
can be reviewed individually. Commit messages should follow [the seven rules of
a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules):

  - Separate subject from body with a blank line
  - Limit the subject line to 50 characters
  - Capitalize the subject line
  - Do not end the subject line with a period
  - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
  - Wrap the body at 72 characters
  - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
